# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

This is my Google Data Analytics Capstone Project, analyzing how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Business Task

Analyze usage patterns to provide insights that can help convert casual riders into annual members and increase long-term revenue.

##  Data Sources

- Divvy 2019 Q1 and 2020 Q1 datasets (publicly available)

##  Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Standardized columns across years
- Parsed date-time fields
- Combined datasets
- Calculated ride length (minutes)
- Filtered invalid durations
- Added day_of_week feature

##  Analysis & Insights

- Casual riders have longer average ride durations
- Casual usage peaks on weekends (leisure)
- Members ride more on weekdays (commuting)

##  Visualizations

- Average ride length by user type
- Number of rides by day of week
- Average ride duration by day of week

##  Recommendations

1. Weekend membership promotions
2. Commuter-focused advertising
3. Personalized offers for frequent casual riders
